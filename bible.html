                <h2>Proverbs</h2>
                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <h4>Prologue: Purpose and Theme</h4>
                <p class="verses">
                    The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:<br>
                    for attaining wisdom and discipline;<br>
                    for understanding words of insight;<br>
                    for aquiring a disciplined and prudent life,<br>
                    doing what is right and just and fair;<br>
                    for giving prudence to the simple,<br>
                    knowledge and discretion to the young&mdash;<br>
                    let the wise listen and add to their learning,<br>
                    and let the discerning get guidance&mdash;<br>
                    for understanding proverbs and parables,<br>
                    the saying and riddles of the wise,<br><br>
                    The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,<br>
                    but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Exhortations to Embrace Wisdom</h4>
                <p class="verses">
                    Listen, my son, to your father's instruction
                    and do not forsake your mother's teaching.<br>
                    They will be a garland to grace your head
                    and a chain to adorn your neck.<br><br>
                    My son, if sinners entice you,<br>
                    do not give into them.<br>
                    If they say, "Come along with us;<br>
                    let's lie in wait for someone's blood,<br>
                    let's waylay some harmless soul;<br>
                    let's swallow them alive, like the grave,<br>
                    and whole, like the pit;<br>
                    we will get all sorts of valuable things
                    and fill our houses with plunder;<br>
                    throw in your lot with us,<br>
                    and we will share a common purse&mdash;<br>
                    my son, do not go along with them,<br>
                    do not set foot on their paths;<br>
                    for their feet rush into sin,<br>
                    they are swift to shed blood.<br>
                    How useless to spread a net
                    in full view of the birds!<br>
                    These men lie in wait for their own blood;<br>
                    they waylay only themselves!<br>
                    Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain;<br>
                    it takes away the lives of those who get it.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Warning Against Rejecting Wisdom</h4>
                    <p class="verses">
                        Wisdom calls aloud in the street,<br>
                        she raises her voice in the public squares;<br>
                        at the head of the noisy streets she cries out,<br>
                        How long will you simple ones love your simple ways?<br>
                        How long will mockers delight in mockery
                        and fools hate knowledge?<br>
                        If you had responded to my rebuke,<br>
                        I would have poured out my my heart to you
                        and made my thoughts known to you.<br>
                        But since you rejected me when I called
                        and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,<br>
                        since you ignored all my advice
                        and would not accept my rebuke,<br>
                        I in turn will laugh at your disaster;<br>
                        I will mock when calamity overtakes you&mdash;<br>
                        when calamity overtakes you like a storm,<br>
                        when distaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,<br>
                        when distress and trouble overwhelm you.<br><br>
                        "Then they will call to me but I will not answer;<br>
                        They will look for me but not find me.<br>
                        Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord,<br>
                        since they wood not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,<br>
                        they will eat the fruit of their ways<br>
                        and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.<br>
                        For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,<br>
                        and the complacency of fools will destroy them;<br>
                        but whoever listens to me will live in safety<br>
                        and be at ease, without fear of harm."

                    <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                    <h4>Moral Benefits of Wisdom</h4>
                    <p class="verses">
                        My son, if you accept my words
                        and store up my commands within you,<br>
                        turning your ear to wisdom
                        and applying your heart to understanding,<br>
                        and if you call out for insight
                        and cry aloud for understanding,<br>
                        and if you look for it as for silver
                        and search for it as for hidden treasure,<br>
                        then you will understand the fear of the LORD
                        and find the knowledge of God.<br>
                        <highligh>For the LORD gives wisdom,</highligh><br>
                        and from his mouth come knowledge and
                        understanding. He holds victory in store for the upright,<br>
                        he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,<br>
                        for he guards the course of the just
                        and protects the way of his faithful ones.<br>
                        Then you will understand what is right and just
                        and fair—every good path.<br>
                        For wisdom will enter your heart,<br>
                        and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.<br>
                        Discretion will protect you,<br>
                        and understanding will guard you.<br>
                        Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men
                        from men whose words are perverse,<br>
                        who leave the straight paths
                        to walk in dark ways,<br>
                        who delight in doing wrong
                        and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,<br>
                        whose paths are crooked
                        and who are devious in their ways.<br>
                        It will save you also from the adulteress,<br>
                        from the wayward wife with her seductive words,<br>
                        who has left the partner of her youth
                        and ignored the covenant she made before God.<br>
                        For her house leads down to death
                        and her paths to the spirits of the dead.<br>
                        None who go to her return
                        or attain the paths of life.<br>
                        Thus you will walk in the ways of good men
                        and keep to the paths of the righteous.<br>
                        For the upright will live in the land,<br>
                        and the blameless will remain in it;<br>
                        but the wicked will be cut off from the land,<br>
                        and the unfaithful will be torn from it.
                    </p>

                        <p class="verses">
                        1 My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,<br>
                        2 for <b>they will prolong your life many years</b> and <b>bring you prosperity.</b><br><br>
                        3 Let love and faithfulness never leave you;<br>
                        bind them around your neck,
                        write them on the tablet of your heart.<br>
                        4 Then you will win favor and a good name
                        in the sight of God and man.<br><br>
                        5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart

                        11 My son, do not despise the LORD’s discipline
                        and do not resent his rebuke,<br>
                        12 because the LORD disciplines those he loves,<br>
                        as a father the son he delights in.<br><br>
                        13 Blessed is the man who finds wisdom,
                        the man who gains understanding,<br>
                        14 for she is more profitable than silver
                        and yields better returns than gold.<br>

                        18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her;<br>
                        those who lay hold of her will be blessed.<br><br>
                        19 By wisdom the LORD laid the earth’s foundations,<br>

                        20 by his knowledge the deeps were divided,<br>

                        21 My son, preserve sound judgment and discernment,<br>
                        do not let them out of your sight;<br>
                        22 they will be life for you,<br>
                        an ornament to grace your neck.<br>
                        23 Then you will go on your way in safety,<br>
                        and your foot will not stumble;<br>
                        24 when you lie down, you will not be afraid;<br>
                        when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.<br>
                        25 Have no fear of sudden disaster
                        or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,<br>
                        26 for the LORD will be your confidence
                        and will keep your foot from being snared.<br><br>
                        27 Do not withhold good from those who deserve it,<br>
                        when it is in your power to act.<br>
                        28 Do not say to your neighbor,<br>
                        “Come back later; I’ll give it tomorrow”&mdash;
                        when you now have it with you.<br><br>
                        29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor,<br>
                        who lives trustfully near you.<br>
                        30 Do not accuse a man for no reason&mdash;when he has done you no harm.<br><br>
                        31 Do not envy a violent man
                        or choose any of his ways,<br>
                        32 for the LORD detests a perverse man
                        but takes the upright into his confidence.<br><br>
                        33 The LORD’s curse is on the house of the wicked,<br>
                        but he blesses the home of the righteous.<br>
                        34 He mocks proud mockers
                        but gives grace to the humble.<br>
                        35 The wise inherit honor, but fools he holds up to shame.</p>
